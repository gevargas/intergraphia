This notebooks demonstrate a methodology for analyzing networks of people to explore the nuanced concept of "invisibilisation" within intellectual communities. By constructing a graph where nodes represent individuals and edges represent connections based on shared attributes (like nationality), and by computing metrics such as the Epistemic Violence Index (EVI) and community detection, we gain valuable tools to move beyond simple rankings of influence.

Instead of solely identifying the most central or highly-ranked individuals, this approach allows us to:

*   **Identify Communities:** Uncover the underlying modular structure of the network, revealing distinct intellectual groups.
*   **Quantify Influence within Context:** Use metrics like EVI to assess an individual's potential influence, not just in isolation, but also in relation to their neighbors and community.
*   **Exhibit the "Invisible":** By comparing individual EVI to the average EVI within communities, we can highlight individuals who, despite being connected, may have less prominent influence within their local sphere (potential invisibilisation), or conversely, those whose influence is disproportionately high, potentially overshadowing others.
*   **Facilitate Intersectional Exploration:** While this notebook primarily uses nationality for edge creation, the framework is extensible. Connections could be defined and analyzed based on shared occupations, genders, or other intersectional attributes, allowing for a deeper exploration of how various factors contribute to network structure and potential invisibilisation.

The interactive visualizations and dashboard further empower exploration, enabling users to filter the network and focus on specific individuals, communities, or connections to reveal patterns that might not be apparent in aggregate statistics. This methodology provides a powerful lens through which to examine the dynamics of influence and visibility within intellectual networks, moving towards a more comprehensive understanding of who is seen, who is heard, and why.
